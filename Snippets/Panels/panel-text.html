<div class="text">

<p>Are you ok with that content-sidebar-container (instead main) name is used for the block combining content and sidebar? Your suggestions? </p>

<p>There was a new class introduced for a div that assigns min-height to the content. It was made to let actions for this page block right follow the content  (before that this block was placed after left navigation that causes lack of usability. </p>

<p>For pages there content isn’t large just to move actions for this page to screen bottom min-height should be assign to the additional div. Are you ok that the css class name for this case is min-width? </p>

<p>Unfortunately it’s just subsidiary div that means nothing for page logic but used for layouting purposes. 
pageTitle has been renamed to page-title – are you ok with that? </p>

</div>
